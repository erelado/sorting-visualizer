## 📙 Description
Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, decreasing, lexicographical, etc).

There are many different sorting algorithms, each has its own advantages and limitations.

An algorithm for sorting can be visualized through this project. Bars are displayed for each element of the array. Colour-coding is used for operations.

### 👨‍💻 Technologies
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Javascript

Using the vanilla versions of the languages was the goal of the project. It provided me a learning tool with added personal value.
